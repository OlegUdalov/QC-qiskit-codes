Here I will store the qiskit codes I made myself.

Below, is the brief descriptions of various codes


1. "QFT_" is the code (function) for the quantum Fourier transform. The code describes it and explores some of the QFT properties. There is also a function perfroming a QFT with various number of qubits.

2. "CuccaroAdder" is the code (function) generating the Curraco adder and analysing how it works.

3. "DrapperAdder" is the code (function) studying the Drapper adder function from the Qiskit library.

4. "Grover_1" is the code realizing and studying Grover algorithm

5. "PhaseOracle" is the code studying the properties of a quantum phase oracle

6. "PhaseKickBack", "CliffordGates", "ToffoliDecomposition" study some basic feature of the quantum circuits

7. "Qtele", "QT1" are examples of quantum teleportation circuits

8. Shor folder is for Shor algorithm
