Here I will store the qiskit codes I made myself.

Below, is the brief descriptions of various folders


1. AlgorithmOptimizationExamples. Here I store some example of circuit optimization (reduction of used qubits and circuit depth).

2. BlueQubit. For the BlueQubit hackathon in Oct 2024

3. Finances. Here I store some algorithms for financial applications.

4. IBM_functions. Testing new feature of IBM Quantum - IBM functions. By Oct 2024 is not available for general public.

5. Library. Some libraries I made.

6. Shor. Shor algorithm I made. Repeat after some paper.

7. Testing various Quantum Computres. Here I will store results of interaction with various QC services provided by different companies. Both real QC and cloud QC simuators.

8. 'textbook' algorithms. Some basic algorithms.
